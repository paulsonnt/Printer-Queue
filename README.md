# Printer-Queue
A single, globally shared printer queue that all processes and threads can read from or write into

I have created the printer queue using an array implementation. The struct print_request is used for the queue so that the id and size can be stored at each array index. I have implemented the FCFS scheduling algorithm using the buffer_index implementation. The size limit of 30 is also maintained by the buffer_index. The command line input is used to set the number of producers and consumers in the program. 5 primary semaphores are used to manage the writing and reading of the queue by both the processes and threads. Rand() is used to create a random number of jobs for each process and random size for each job. Rand() is also used to create random amounts of time for the processes to wait in between processes and consumers to sleep between loops in the while loop. The shared memory and semaphores are deallocated right before the end of the program. Threads are exited within the consumer function. The ctrl+C signal is caught and then the program continues as normal and terminates once the processes are finished.
